# fNIRS Data Processing pipelines for natual language processing (NLP)

This repository contains different MATLAB and Python scripts for fNIRS data processing pipelines (NLP tasks). 

**NOTE**:
## Suprisal Calculation

If you would like to calculate surprisal values yourself, please request access to the following package:

ðŸ‘‰ [LingPred](https://github.com/cnllab/lingpred)

Access to LingPred is managed by **Dr. Jonathan Brennan (University of Michigan)**.  
Please reach out to him directly to obtain the necessary permissions before running the surprisal pipeline.  

Once you have access, follow the setup instructions provided in the LingPred repository to install dependencies and run the surprisal extraction tools.

## Overview
This repository is organized into two main parts:

1. **Three-Way Split Analysis**  
   - Data preprocessing and experimental setup with three-way splits  
   - Used for [your research goal / motivation]

2. **NLP Forecasting with Future Words**  
   - Predictive modeling with language models  
   - Forecasting brain/behavioral responses (or other target variable) using future word information
