# Project Title

_A short description of what this repository does and why it exists._

---

## Overview
This repository is organized into two main parts:

1. **Three-Way Split Analysis**  
   - Data preprocessing and experimental setup with three-way splits  
   - Used for [your research goal / motivation]

2. **NLP Forecasting with Future Words**  
   - Predictive modeling with language models  
   - Forecasting brain/behavioral responses (or other target variable) using future word information

## Part 1: Three-Way Split Analysis

### Goals
- [Write here the purpose of this analysis]
- [Example: To evaluate model generalization under different splits]

### Methods
- [Describe your methodology]
- [List datasets used]
- [Key equations or steps]

### How to Run
```bash
cd part1_three_way_split
python scripts/run_analysis.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

### Results
- [Insert summary / plots / metrics]

---

## Part 2: NLP Forecasting with Future Words

### Goals
- [State your forecasting objective]
- [Example: Predict brain response using surprisal values at future words]

### Methods
- [Models: GPT-2, LLaMA, etc.]
- [Feature extraction pipeline]
- [Evaluation metrics]

### How to Run
```bash
cd part2_nlp_forecasting
python scripts/run_forecast.py --model gpt2 --future 5
```

### Results
- [Add figures / performance tables]
